            <h1>Design Philosophy</h1>
            <p>As a former biochemist, I think of the design process as if it were the <b>scientific method</b>: research, hypothesize, experiment to collect data, and use data to prove or disprove your hypothesis.</p>

                <p>User research is my <b>strength</b>. Talking and listening to real people is invaluable in the product design process. I focus on <b>asking questions</b> around an informal product hypothesis, and then <b>analyze the answers</b> to determine if my hypothesis was on the right track. I began building this skill while working as a high school teacher in New York City; I became very aware that students do not tell you what they need. You must infer their needs from their responses.</p>

                <p>While I admit to having an informal hypothesis in the empathize stage, the define stage is where my <b>hypothesis is developed</b>. I synthesize user-research into personas and determine user-goals. I construct my hypothesis by defining the problem to be solved and measurable outcomes as a result of solving the problem.

                <p>Once the team understands who the users are (with the help of personas), I believe in <b>team ideation</b> using whiteboards and sketches to <b>determine solutions to the problem</b>.

                  <h3><small>Role</small></h3>
                  <p>user experience designer, product manager</p>

                  <h3><small>Responsibilities</small></h3>
                  <p>end-to-end product design, including competitive analysis, paper prototypes, low-fidelity wireframes, annotated wireframes, high function prototypes, usability testing, sketches, user-flows, input field validation guidelines, user stories, backlog grooming</p>

                  <h3><small>Problem</small></h3>
                  <p>The teacher-facing side of our product, the administration system, was quickly aging-out. The main purpose of the admin system was to distribute the product to students. In addition, the administration system was built for one admin user-level, teachers, when in practice we needed to incorporate multiple admin user-levels. How might we update our administration system for administrators to manage students, staff, and products?</p>

                  <h3><small>Requirements</small></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Use existing navigation scheme put in place by previous developer</li>
                    <li>Scale&#8212accommodate hundreds of thousands of users</li>
                    <li>Flexible UI that can work with different user-levels and fit each user&#8217s task flows</li>
                    <li>Incorporate various administration levels, including district administators, school administrators, teachers, and customer service</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3><small>Tools Used</small></h3>
                  <p>Axure, InDesign, Illustrator, Sketch, pencil and paper</p>

                  <h3><small>Solution</small></h3>
                  <p>Two main interfaces, table views and forms, exist throughout the admin system that can incorporate four different user-levels and the actions required for each user.</p>

                  <h3><small>Team</small></h3>
                  <p>project manager, 4 developers, 2 QAs</p>

                  <h3><small>Design Timeline</small></h3>
                  <p>3 months</p>

                  <h3><small>Process</small></h3>
                  <p>When I was first given this project, I set out to answer several questions:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>What are the objects that are needed in the system, or in other words, what and who are we managing?</li>
                    <li>Which actions need to be performed on objects by each user-level?</li>
                    <li>What information does each user-level need about each object?</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h3><small>Object mapping</small></h3>
                  <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-4">
                      <p>After gathering user requirements from marketing and completing a competitive analysis, I mapped the objects in the system to the actions needed and information that could be displayed. This helped me to make sense of what objects were needed in the system.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-8">

                  <h3><small>Paper Prototypes</small></h3>
                  <p>At the beginning of the project, it was one developer and I working within a short timeframe to set up the foundation for the rest of the project. Because of this, we used a lean framework to develop the admin system. We determined the best way to display thousands of objects would be in table form, with the ability to select an object from the table and perform an action on the item. The actions would be available as buttons at the top of the table. We agreed that the only action that this pattern would not incorporate is editing the object. Editing would take place in a separate form. Clicking the object within the table would take the user to an editable form. Since editing would take place in a form, we were able to separate what we needed to display to the user with the amount of information that needed to be stored for each object. This would also allow for flexibility in the amount of columns we could display in the table.</p>

                  <h3 class="margin-top-sm"><small>Iteration 1 Sitemap</small></h3>
                  <p>Using the tables and forms we had sketched and the object mapping exercise, I created an architecture that could be used for all user-levels. District users were defined as district coaches, district leaders, and instructional technology specialists and were given the highest level of permissions. School users incorporated principals, vice principals, department heads, and school IT. The teacher user was a teacher within a school and had the lowest level of permissions.</p>

                  <p>The developer I was working with had been working in parallel on the tables, forms, and backend while I ironed out the information architecture. We were able to create a high function prototype to test on users to validate our assumptions thus far. Due to the research, we knew identified school IT personnel as our target users. Within schools, this role has the responsibility of setting up products for all of the teachers and students within a school. Users were given tasks such as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You have created a class called &#8220English Period 4.&#8221 Given a list of students, add students to the class.</li>
                    <li>It is the beginning of the school year and you are prepping for beginning of the year meetings. First up on the agenda is distributing the classes and students in those classes to teachers. Print off the materials to give each teacher the list of students in each class so that they can start preparing.</li>
                    <li>A parent calls in and explains that the information for her son, Harry Miller, is wrong. There is a typo in his last name. In addition, he can’t login to access his homework. When he tries to login to the system she gets a message saying &#8220Incorrect username or password.&#8221 Attempt to help her resolve both issues. </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3 class="margin-top-sm"><small>Iteration 2 Sitemap</small></h3>
                  <p>Several factors led to an iteration of the sitemap. Some of the highlights include:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>We narrowed our MVP down to focus on the school-user.</li>
                    <li>Usability feedback led to a revision in navigation to tables within tables.</li>
                    <li>The amount of actions available per table was trimmed to maintain our timeline.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h3 class="margin-top-sm"><small>Successes and Learnings</small></h3>
                  <p>At the onset of the project, I faced pushback from stakeholders on reorganizing the information architecture of the admin system. There was hesitation to reorganize the existing 20+ pages that were deemed necessary to have a functioning admin system. I was able to align all stakeholders once they understood that the same amount of functions, and more, were possible within 12 pages of content using two main containers. For example, our former system allowed a user to reset a student password four pages deep into the userflow, while our new system allows users to reset a student&#8217s password on the first page.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>While I designed for the future functionality for district and teacher users, as was requested, the scope of the project was outside the timeframe my team faced. I learned my lesson in narrowing focus based on the size of my team. Throughout the project, I communicated with developers and testers to discuss the feasibility and details of each of the features within the admin system. Because of the team working together to trim and create the product, we were able to release on time.</p>

                  <hr>

                  <h3><small>Role</small></h3>
                  <p>user experience designer, product manager</p>

                  <h3><small>Responsibilities</small></h3>
                  <p>user goals, competitive analysis, information architecture, annotated wireframes, usability testing, user stories, backlog grooming</p>

                  <h3><small>Problem</small></h3>
                  <p>Data-driven instruction is a hot topic in education. Educators need a way to quickly determine student progress in order to adjust their curriciulum to the needs of their students. How might we use the information within our database of problems to create reports for educators?</p>

                  <h3><small>Requirements</small></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Utilize the problem database structure to display relevant information</li>
                    <li>Ability to view student progress based on state standards</li>
                    <li>Have a maximum amount of data that can be displayed so that load time is fast</li>
                    <li>Incorporate work that had already been started on the front and backends for this project</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3><small>Solution</small></h3>
                  <p>Educators are slow to adopt technology and shy away from complex reports, so I created a UI that is simple and consistent between all reports. The flexibility with each report is rooted in the filters available on each page.</p>

                  <h3><small>Team</small></h3>
                  <p>project manager, 4 developers, 2 QAs</p>

                  <h3><small>Design Timeline</small></h3>
                  <p>6 weeks</p>

                  <h3><small>Process</small></h3>
                  <p>This project had already been started before I was handed over all design responsibilities. I was asked to step in because the design of the project was veering off track. A prior developer had starting designing 15 reports, and my task was to determine user goals and incorporate that with his work.</p>

                  <h3><small>Competitive Analysis</small></h3>
                  <p>When viewing what had already been completed, I noticed that the existing reports could be categorized in several ways: standards-based, assignments-based, and grading task reports. A standards-based report displayed how many standards had been assessed. An assignments-based report displayed the grades for each student for a particular assignment. A grading task report showed the number of assignments that the teacher needed to grade and the problems that needed to be graded.</p>
                  <p>I completed a competitive analysis of other reports in online education products. In my research, I came to the conclusion that we were unique in offering both standards- and assignments-based reports. Other companies only offered standards-based reports.</p>
                  <p>Through my research, I discovered that the mental model teachers have of grading tasks is a gradebook. Teachers did not expect to find grading tasks within the reports section of our product. I suggested removing the grading task reports and functions to a gradebook section of the product.</p>

                  <h3><small>User Goals</small></h3>
                  <p>Five different users would need access to our reports: district leaders, school leaders, teachers, students, and parents. Each user would need to be presented different variations of the same data, based on their user needs. I grouped parents and students together because we had no plans to develop a parent only interface and their needs were similar to students.</p>

                  <h3><small>Types of Reports</small></h3>
                  <p>Based on the use-cases, I created high-level descriptions of the types of reports that each type of user might expect.</p>

                  <figure class="margin-top-sm">
                    <figcaption class="text-center">Five proposed reports</figcaption>

                  </figure>

                  <h3><small>Information Architecture</small></h3>
                  <p>To fit the use-cases, four pages were needed. Drilling down into information in the report would take the user to the next report.
                    <figure class="margin-top-sm">
                      <figcaption class="text-center">IA for reports</figcaption>

                    </figure>

                    <h3><small>Filters</small></h3>
                    <p>Because the pages for each user needed to be similar for timeline purposes, filters were the key to customizing reports for each user-level. Filters would allow each of the pages to display the relevant information for each user: District, School, Teacher, or Student/Parent.</p>

                    <h3><small>Successes and Learnings</small></h3>
                    <p>One of the greatest successes of this project was that the database creation I had worked on previously could now be shown visually to educators. The database proved to be flexible enough to display the data in multiple formats. While I was designing the details for our database, I had always had the hopes that I would be part of designing the data visualization portion for educators.</p>
                    <p>This is the first end-to-end feature that I designed. From designing reports, I improved my communication skills between developers and stakeholders. I refined my deliverables and customized them to my audience to best communicate with the developers and persuade stakeholders to approve the plans. Because of this, I was able to align all stakeholders and developers to agree to a plan of action.</p>
                    <p>The most challenging aspect of this project was facing the realization of load times for the reports I was proposing. Many of my ideas had to be refined due to the amount of information (and thus time) that would be displayed on the page. The developers and I reached a happy medium that would allow for all user-goals to be met, as well as satisy load times.</p>
                    <p>Due to time, the amount of filters available on the first release was trimmed. We narrowed the filters down to a minimum viable product for each of the pages.</p>
                    <p>In the finals below, click throughs to the next page happen when clicking on the triple bar and are dependent on the filters selected.</p>

                  <p>Our company had tens of thousands of pieces of content that were not connected. In anticipation of state-specific variations of Common Core State Standards, we wanted to create a database consisting of all content in a way that was flexible enough to quickly align content to both high school state math standards and high school math textbooks so that we could produce products faster.</p>

                  <p>This was my first major project within the tech industry. It was a rude awakening. Luckily, I had a team that trusted me and gave me constructive feedback along the way. I learned what was feasible within our system, and what was not feasible. I learned how to think about scalability and longterm maintenance.</p>
                  <p>Following the creation of the database, three additional digital texts came out within the course of several months using the database of tagged problems. The tag system has expanded to online reporting (data visualization) for teachers to determine areas where students are struggling and excelling.</p>
