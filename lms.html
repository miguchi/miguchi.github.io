                              <p>At the Seattle branch of Perfection Learning, a digital education start-up focusing on high school math and science online homework products for teachers and students, the administration system, or learning management system (LMS), for teachers had aged out. The main purpose of the LMS was to distribute the product to students, and manage student users, classes, schools, and districts. In addition, the administration system was built for one admin user-level, teachers, when in practice we needed to incorporate multiple admin user-levels.</p>
                              <p>How might we update our LMS for administrators and teachers to manage students, classes, staff, and products?</p>

                            <p>When I was first given this project, I set out to answer several questions:
                              <ol class="project-list">
                                <li>What are the objects that are needed in the system, or in other words, what and who are we managing?</li>
                                <li>Which actions need to be performed on objects by each user-level?</li>
                                <li>What information does each user-level need about each object?</li>
                              </ol>
                            </p>

                            <p>After gathering user requirements from marketing and completing a competitive analysis, I mapped the objects in the system to the actions needed and information that could be displayed. This helped me to make sense of what objects were needed in the system.</p>

                            <p>At the beginning of the project, it was one developer and I working within a short timeframe to set up the foundation for the rest of the project. Because of this, we used a lean framework to develop the admin system. The prior design was oriented around having one screen per task. This made for a large information architecture and forced the user to learn each individual screen when completing a task. Because many of our user base was not tech savvy, I wanted to focus our design on simple containers that were consistent between all tasks. We determined the best way to display thousands of objects would be in table form, with the ability to select an object from the table and perform an action on the item. The actions would be available as buttons at the top of the table. We agreed that the only action that this pattern would not incorporate is editing the object. Editing would take place in a separate form. Clicking the object within the table would take the user to an editable form. Since editing would take place in a form, we were able to separate what we needed to display to the user, but allow for more information to be stored on each object. In other words, the amount of information in the table form would not limit the information about the object. This would also allow for flexibility in the amount of columns we could display in the table.

                            <p>Using the tables and forms we had sketched and the object mapping exercise, I created an architecture that could be used for all user-levels. District users were defined as district coaches, district leaders, and instructional technology specialists and were given the highest level of permissions. School users incorporated principals, vice principals, department heads, and school IT. The teacher user was a teacher within a school and had the lowest level of permissions. I mapped out each of the user flows on top of the IA to determine if the proposed IA would work for all users.

                        <p>Due to the research, we identified school IT personnel as our target users. Within schools, this role has the responsibility of setting up products for all of the teachers and students within a school. Users were given tasks such as:<br/>

                          <p>At the onset of the project, I faced pushback from stakeholders on reorganizing the information architecture of the admin system. There was hesitation to reorganize the existing 20+ pages that were deemed necessary to have a functioning admin system. I was able to align all stakeholders once they understood that the same amount of functions, and more, were possible within 12 pages of content using two main containers. For example, our former system allowed a user to reset a student password four pages deep into the userflow, while our new system allows users to reset a student’s password on the first page.</p>


                          <p>While I designed for the future functionality for district and teacher users, as was requested, the scope of the project was outside the timeframe my team faced. I learned my lesson in narrowing focus based on the size of my team. Throughout the project, I communicated with developers and testers to discuss the feasibility and details of each of the features within the admin system. Because of the team working together to trim and create the product, we were able to release on time.</p>
